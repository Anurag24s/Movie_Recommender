**Movie Recommender System**
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System! This project is designed to help users find and explore movies tailored to their taste. The system leverages a dataset of over 5000 movies, providing personalized recommendations based on user input.

** Introduction
The Movie Recommender System is a web application that allows users to search for movies, get recommendations, add movies to a playlist, like movies, and leave comments. The recommendations are based on the similarity between movies, calculated using data analysis techniques.

** Features
Search for Movies: Users can search for movies by entering a keyword in the search bar. The system provides instant suggestions based on the input.
Recommendations: Upon selecting a movie, users can get a list of recommended movies that are similar to the selected one.

** Data Analysis
The recommendation system is built on a dataset of over 5000 movies. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the data analysis process:

** Data Collection: The dataset includes detailed information about each movie, such as title, genre, director, cast, and more.
** Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicates.
** Feature Extraction: Relevant features were extracted from the dataset to build the recommendation model. These features include movie titles, genres, and other metadata.
** Similarity Calculation: The similarity between movies was calculated using cosine similarity based on the features. This allows the system to recommend movies that are similar to the one selected by the user.
